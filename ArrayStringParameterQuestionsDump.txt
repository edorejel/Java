# How is a parameter like an array?
It passes data through it, and the index of the data can be created from it.
A parameter is a "specialized variable."
An array would be accessed using the array reference variable.

# How is a parameter different from an array?
A parameter does not store data. An array is used to store data.
An array has a finite size and data type.
A parameter only has a data type.

# How are Strings like arrays?
Strings can be accessed and manipulated using their indices.
Arrays are accessed and manipulated using their indices.

A bit of work is required, but Strings can be rearranged, and possibly sorted or rearranged using sorting algorithms made from scratch, specifically for Strings.

Arrays can be sorted efficiently using sorting algorithms.
