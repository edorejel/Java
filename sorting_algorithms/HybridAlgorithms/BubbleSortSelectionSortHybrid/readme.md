# Bubble Sort Selection Sort Hybrid Algorithm


# Explanation

__Step 1: Selection Sort__
Finds the minimum element in the unsorted part and places it at the current position. This pass gives an initial partial ordering.


__Step 2: Bubble Sort__
Refines the order by swapping adjacent elements if needed. It terminates early if the list is already sorted.
