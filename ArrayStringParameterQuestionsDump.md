# How is a parameter like an array?
- It passes data through it, and an index variable of the data can be created from it using the "length".
- A parameter is a "specialized variable."
- An array would be accessed using the array reference variable.
- Arrays and parameters have a data type.
- A parameter can have a copy of it created in the method body.
- An array can have a copy of it created it as well.
- The data type of the array cannot change without copying to a new array with a different data type.
- Thus, the size of the array, and the data type of the array cannot change.
- The data type of a parameter cannot change by definition of it being a parameter.

# How is a parameter different from an array?
- A parameter does not store data. An array is used to store data.
- An array has a finite size and permanent data type.
- A parameter only has a permanent data type.
- A parameter allows data to pass through it.


# How are Strings like arrays?
- Strings can be accessed and manipulated using their indices.
- Arrays are accessed and manipulated using their indices.
- A bit of work is required, but Strings can be rearranged, and possibly sorted or rearranged using sorting algorithms made from scratch, specifically for Strings. Sorting algorithms are typically used for numeric data types.
- So a bubble sort from scratch would be made specifically for Strings.
- Arrays can be sorted efficiently using sorting algorithms.
- For loops can be used on Strings and arrays to manipulate their data efficiently.
